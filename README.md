# Sorting
Sorting Algorighms.
Program is (a little) far from ready.
The code Mixes a sorted list...
Then the program sorts lists by Bubble Sort/Merge Sort .
the code shows how it's sorting using colums or stars *
the code creates it's own list to sort .
the code let's you choose how long the list would be .

the code doesn't do much yet...
But it's totally awesome!
